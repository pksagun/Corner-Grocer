# Corner-Grocer
C++ program that analyzes and tracks item purchase frequency in a grocery store.

This project is all about making a C++ program to track how many times items were bought in a grocery store. The program reads a file that lists the purchased items, counts how many times each item appears, and shows the results in a menu-driven interface. It also saves the results in a backup file and shows a histogram to make it easier to understand.

One thing I did well was keeping the code clean and easy to read. I used clear names for variables and added comments so anyone looking at the code can understand what each part does.

If I improve this project in the future, I would work on making the file reading part faster and maybe use more advanced methods for handling big data. I could also separate the code into more files to make it more organized and modular.

The hardest part for me was writing the logic to count how many times each item appeared in the file. I solved this by checking online resources like tutorials and Stack Overflow. I also learned how to write the results to another file called frequency.dat.

I learned useful skills from this project like how to use file input/output, maps, and how to make a simple user interface. These skills will help me in other coding projects and classes.

I added comments, used good indentation, and kept the code organized by using functions to make my code easy to read and change later.
